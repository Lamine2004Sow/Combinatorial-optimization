# Combinatorial Optimization Experiments

This repository contains small experiments and implementations of various combinatorial optimization methods.  
The goal is to explore and compare exact, heuristic, metaheuristic, and dynamic programming techniques on classic problems.

## Problems Covered
- Knapsack Problem  
- Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)  
- Ring-Star Problem  
- Other small graph or optimization challenges

## Methods Implemented
- Exact methods (e.g., Branch & Bound, DP)
- Heuristics (greedy approaches, constructive algorithms)
- Metaheuristics (Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, etc.)

## Purpose
This project is part of my learning process in combinatorial optimization, aiming to test different algorithmic strategies and analyze their performance.

## Structure
The repository includes:
- Problem definitions
- Algorithm implementations
- Small tests and result files

## Requirements
